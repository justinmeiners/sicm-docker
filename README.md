# SICM Docker

Want to play with [SICM](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html)?
Here is a docker image to get you started.


## Other projects

I found [this](https://github.com/apatil/docker-sicm),
but it hasn't been updated in almost 10 years.
I also don't use emacs.
